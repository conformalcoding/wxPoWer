# Motivation

## Scope and purpose

This document has been written to state the case for the irrefutable need of proof-of-work methods for combatting nefarious actors on social media platforms.

A draft specification for text-based proof-of-work, described as _wxPoWer v0_, is detailed in the [specification doc](spec.md).

## Flying blind

Although artificial intelligence has made extensive leaps over the last few years, the internet has been plagued by non-humans for a while. The [dead internet theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Internet_theory) has been around for a while. But previously, bots would be used to effect engagement and manipulation which couldn't be easily distinguished from human users at the time, obviously. View counts on streams and numbers of likes are effective ways of faking engagement to manipulate others. Now more than ever we need a radical, perhaps even revolutionary, countermeasure, to deal with those vectors that were left: generative AI, which can pump out convincing textual comments and even videos.

Those of us who have been on the internet for _N_ number of years have had _N_ years of increasingly encountering [CAPTCHAs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAPTCHA) on web services to assess our primate properties. But bots can outsource the solving of them to a human "CAPTCHA farm". These have become increasingly sophisticated over time in response and frequently render the current gold standard inadequate. Where, when and how does the cat-and-mouse game end?

## Tomorrow

The author is increasingly concerned that, in just a few years, there will be a time when AI can solve all possible visual and auditory challenges more reliably than the average human. This would be an apocalyptic tipping point. What remains after it? Presumably the only kind of approach for authenticating the human being would then be highly invasive biometric methods.

***This must be fought back against.*** There are good ideas out there. This repository contains my proof-of-concept effort. I am not saying that this idea, or my implementation of it, is the best. But potential solutions which are not of the CAPTCHA kind should be looked into ***now*** and taken seriously. One must take a look at this experiment with an open mind.
